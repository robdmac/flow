// REVISION: flow-v170-dry-scenes
//
// The world the balloon and the rockets fly through, on the fire's dials: the
// level is a target altitude, eased toward, and the world scrolls past the
// vehicle as it climbs. Behind everything, a sky painted per row by that
// row's altitude: soil under the grass, a pale horizon, day blue, navy,
// near-black, then the painted black of space (the terminal's own background
// is rarely black and would look lighter than the atmosphere below it). On
// the ground, trees and houses (a subclass can put a launch site there);
// above it birds, the layered clouds, then stars and Earth's blue rim.
//
// Every scenery cell is a pure function of its world position, so the world
// is stable as it scrolls. In a tall column (the spine) the vehicle really
// rises up the screen from the ground, and the world only scrolls once it
// nears the top. A subclass draws the vehicle (and anything around it).
//
// At night (`night`, set by `/flow night` or the clock) the sky is near-black all the way
// to the ground, stars show at every height, clouds are moonlit, the grass
// and trees are dark, the houses' windows are lit, and a moon hangs high
// (the same night as every scene's: night.ts). Night falls and lifts over a
// couple of seconds rather than in one frame. While Claude waits on the
// person the vehicle holds where it is (the balloon hovers, its climb easing
// off) and the whole sky breathes in sepia (waiting.ts).
