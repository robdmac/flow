// Each session's own settings: what `/flow` set in it, kept under the
// session's id over the defaults every session starts from (/config in
// Claude Code, ~/.pi/agent/flow.json in pi). A field the session never set
// follows the default. Pure: no engine imports; the adapters keep the
// records (Claude Code in its store, one key a session; pi in the session).
//
// The defaults can change under a running session (another session's
// `/flow save`, a /config change elsewhere) without it hearing: the adapters
// read them afresh before anything compares with them, and what the session
// shows that they no longer hold becomes its own (pinShown). So nothing done
// elsewhere changes a running session, a resume shows what it showed, and
// `/flow save` saves exactly what it shows.
