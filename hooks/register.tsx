// REVISION: flow-v130-picker
//
// Flow for Claude Code, by Rob Macrae: ambient scenes (a fire, the surf, a ski run,
// rockets, a hot-air balloon and more) drawn as one terminal `Raster` in the
// band above the prompt (5 rows) or in a tall pane docked beside the
// transcript (the spine), and repainted with `$.ui.blit`: ~14 fps while busy,
// 8 fps when calm, not at all while off screen or a frame comes out unchanged.
// Claude desktop has no Raster: there each frame is drawn as one `Svg` holding
// the scene as a small image (svg.ts), redrawn up to 10 times a second.
//
// Auto mode (the default) moves with the work Claude is doing: idle it sits
// at a low glow (or dark); a turn lifts it by effort, streamed output keeps
// it going, edits push it by lines written, commands spark, reads and any
// other tool (an MCP server's) spark a little, subagents add to
// the scene and stoke it, a failed command or a compaction shows as smoke,
// and a nearly-full context as blue (each scene shows these its own way).
// While Claude waits on you (a permission dialog, its question, a plan to
// approve) the scene settles, holds and breathes in sepia (waiting.ts), and
// with sound on a soft chime marks the wait's start.
//
// Settings are per session. The `userConfig` rows in /config (mode, style,
// idle, level, layout, time, sound, volume) are the defaults every session starts
// from; `/flow` changes only the session it runs in, at once (a /config
// write would reload the module and restart the scene), and keeps the change
// in the store under the session's id, so a reload or a resume brings it
// back. `/flow save` writes the session's settings to /config, the default
// for new sessions; `/flow reset` puts the session back on it. A change made
// in /config itself is a default, and shows in that session at once. The
// defaults are read afresh before anything compares with them (another
// session may have saved since): a running session keeps what it shows, and
// `/flow save` saves exactly that. Only a scene's own name is ever written
// to /config; a row left holding one Flow no longer takes (a scene since
// renamed or dropped) is written back as the one it stands for. `/flow help`
// lists the command's forms (see settings.ts, sessions.ts).
//
// `/flow pick` opens a second pane, the picker: every scene as a live
// thumbnail (picker.ts), a Button under each that the focus ring walks
// (arrows, Tab), Enter or a click or its number to pick (as `/flow <scene>`
// does, this session alone), Esc to close.
