// REVISION: flow-v124-volume
//
// Soundscapes. Claude Code's `$.audio.play` plays a clip (macOS `afplay`) at a
// gain set when it starts; it can't loop smoothly or change a clip as it
// plays. So nothing loops:
//
// - A bed: one stream a scene. Claude Code plays at most four clips at once
//   for a plugin (it refuses the fifth), so a scene's layers (`LAYERS`, each
//   tuned against real recordings) are mixed ahead, by scripts/make-sounds.ts,
//   into one take for each of its moods (`MOODS`: a band of the level, the
//   balloon's burner, a rocket's phase). Long takes (BED_MS), each crossfading
//   into the next (`bedStep`); when the mood or the level changes, a fresh take
//   crossfades in rather than wait for the next. That leaves two plays at least
//   for events.
// - Events: what happens on screen (a stage separating, a sonic boom, the
//   catch, splashdown) plays its clip at once (`EVENTS`); small, dense ones
//   (a bubble bursting, a spark) are synthesized here and gathered a quarter
//   second at a time into one clip (`burst`), each at its moment.
// - The volume: the sound setting (`/flow sound 1-10`) scales every play as it
//   starts (`volumeGain`), never past the gain at which a clip clips.
//
// Pure: no engine imports, unit-tested directly.
